# **Donglalu-Proxy**

**"Donglalu Proxy is the best proxy site known to mankind." - Allah** 

In all seriousness though, Donglalu Proxy is not intended to be a serious project, I have worked on this simply for improving my knowledge of coding sites and for fun. If you wish for actual proxies I would recommend reaching out to TitaniumNetwork for their services. I would also like to note to not expect much, as I'm new to this and I don't have any intentions for large scale work. Also I don't intend to offend anyone with this name, I just put it for the memes.
