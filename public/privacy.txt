Privacy Policy of Donglalu Proxy

We will steal all of your data & sell them to CCP. If you have problems, then deal with it.

In all seriousness though, no data is currently being stolen (I don't even know how to log data since I'm an idiot at coding).
This site itself is open source, so if you really don't believe me you can check the code yourself.

This site itself is completely legal, however individiuals might choose to browse illegal content via the proxy.
If you have any legal requests regarding this information about individiuals that are rulebreakers, Just email me at hentiemaster@protonmail.com

If there are any issues with the proxy itself, do contact https://github.com/binary-person as they are the ones that have created the proxy itself (Womginx), and I merely just use it.

The only cookie used is a simple boolean that determines if you're a robot or not.

Legal Request Contact:
Just email me at hentiemaster@protonmail.com, the email will be checked from time to time.
